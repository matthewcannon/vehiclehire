===========
a web application which explores: -
 * domain-driven design
 * different end-to-end testing styles
 * specification by example
 * movement towards cqrs

problem
=======
the first mvf makes some simplifying assumptions about cancellation policies. without these simplifications it would be difficult to take small steps towards a fuller implementation. the persistence model declares some awkward relational data constraints, which cannot be simplified. how is it possible to get started with end-to-end testing when the simplifications required by the mvf are not supported by the underlying relational model?
